- 👋 Hi, I’m @ayyuru
- 👀 I’m interested in anything exciting to learn; this could be theoretical or applied mathematics as well as any tools that will take these abstract ideas and will give birth to them in bits and qubits
- 🌱 I’m currently learning whatever I like to learn today.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on whatever I can afford to think
- 📫 I can be reached at ayyuru@gmail.com
